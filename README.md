# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This is a Simple Notes application that has following capabilities:
1. Notes are created in 3 categories (Personal, Professional, Health)
2. Any number of notes can be added in any of the categories
3. Notes can be removed
4. Notes can be edited
5. Notes can be edited to change the category
6. Notes can be searched based on the title.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
